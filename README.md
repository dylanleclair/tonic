  <h1>tonic: a simple and refreshing game framework</h1>

  My first deep dive into engine design, tonic aims to be a lightning fast backbone for 2D games. It aims to be easy to use, providing out of the box support for collision detection, debugging, atlas and tilesheet support, sprites, animations, and much more!

# Highlights
- **Unidirectional data flow**: as much as possible, data flows in one direction down the tree of components in a scene. 
- **Easy to use**, tonic works with various tools to help you make games faster. 

# Dependencies
- Built off of OpenGL
- Uses GLFW as a window manager
- Uses GLM for math
- GLEW

# Work with tonic

tonic is developed using Visual Studio, and can be opened from the .sln file in the root directory!
